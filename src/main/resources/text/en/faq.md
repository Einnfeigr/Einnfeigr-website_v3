# Frequently asked questions
I collected some frequently asked questions from people and listed them here. 
If you have something else to answer- please contact me.

## General
### Is there someone helping you?
No. Einnfeigr is one man project, so 99.9% of content you see here made on my own  

## Site
### Why do you need a website?
Well, your own website is well-organized and customized system for all your needs.  
You don't have any restrictions and limitations (except of hardware indeed).  

### What is this all about?
This site is mainly about photos.  

### Why don't you use social media like Instagram to share your content?
These services are mostly used to make money, not art.
I don't want to compete with paid posts.  
Furthermore, these services are not giving ability to share timeless content:
posted content is sorted by time, and usually people see only newest things.  

### What's your site's stack?
Java with Spring framework, Handlebars, Stylus, JS. You can read more at [about](/about) page.

## Photos
### What's your setup?
Nikon D5600 with 18-55mm stock lens and 35mm F1.8 AF-S DX lens.

### You rarely make photos of people, don't you?
Yep, it's hard work because your main goal is to satisfy client.
Not many people like to see my ideas implemented in photos of them, so I have to make photos 
depending on some standards.  
But if I found someone who likes what I do and don't mind being shown here- you see him.  

### Why don't you show photos instantly using camera display?
Photos made with camera are initially written not as photos, but as raw sensor data. 
You have to adjust some settings to view any raw data.  
While some of settings are usually auto-adjusted well, others needed to be corrected manually.  

## Videos
### Why there is no people in your videos?
It's extremely hard to shoot videos with people (imho). 
You have to organize some sort of scenario, find matching people, gather them, train somehow. 

### What are these names about? Looks like random symbols
This is Old-Norsk translation of video name. 
Usually, I make name of two or three words.  
When I done with words, I translate them into Old-Norsk, and then join to get one.
